# Cloud/Hosting Solution Review

For your website you should consider the scale of the business as a first priority. There are many options out there that will allow complete flexibility on how your website. Here i will cover a few important elements to consider such as, cost, maintenance, scalability and security when starting your business.

A Web hosting plan normally comes with a monthly fee, which makes budgeting easier for smaller businesses. Providers such as "Host Gator" offer basic plans that include domain registration, website hosting, security and email service all starting from $2.75-%5.25 per month. This is perfect even if you are on a very slim budget.

Cloud hosting normally follows a pay-as-you-go scheme which is dependant on usage. This is calculated through server time, bandwidth and storage which means there can be an influx in price if the traffic is heavy. This can be particularly difficult to manage during holidays where order demands are high and can cause the system to slow down or even server crashes. However, this may be a very valid option for a small business as if the traffic is low then so is the cost.

Web hosting platforms are not the best when used for high spikes in traffic. If the bakery gains popularity very quickly and the hosts plan doesn't reflect that level, you may experience downtime or slow downs within the system. This is why planning the scale of the business should be taken into account and planning beforehand. You can change your plan later down the line.

Cloud based, on the other hand, are perfect when dealing with saleability. As when your business grows the host will automatically scale to the current demand to ensure a smooth experience. This will of course be reflected on the price as more demand and more traffic will cost more to run. But this works perfectly with sudden spikes.

When it comes to setting up the website its better to lean towards a system that builds for you as it is less time consuming and you can focus more on your business. Web hosting allows this as a lot of providers offer a one-click set up method where everything is done for you. This includes content management system such as WordPress which also includes website building tools to streamline the start up procedure. Cloud hosting is a lot more technical as it requires you to have an understanding of web hosting and server management which can be confusing to non-technical users. Providers such as AWS do however provide plenty of documents and templates which can assist should you wish.

For maintenance and security web-hosting is also the best option of the two as most packages provide the servers updates and security. This is a care and risk free option as the host will take all of those responsibilities. This will allow to focus more on the content of the business rather than the back end. With cloud based hosting, although the host will control the server configuration and maintenance, it is more hand on for the user and they will need to provide the server updates and security. The user would also be in charge of monitoring the health of the server to ensure it is running properly which is not ideal for non-technical users.

For a small bakery I would suggest using a Web-hosting plan such as Host Gator. This is because it offers low costs as well as very easy set ups with next to no requirements to get involved there after. This allows you to focus on the business and not worried about the technical side.
