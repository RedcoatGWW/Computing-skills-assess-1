# Reflection

I have enjoyed working with mySQL as I am very interested in back end development and how it works along side apps and websites. Creating the Tech Stack website was a great introduction to using various languages and tools together to make a functional product. When I began the project, I was set back with 404 error codes when connecting to my database. After debugging my code by inserting print statements into my connection lines, I was able to find a string that wasnâ€™t closed and resolved the issue.

Another issue I encountered contain situations where a string would not be called correctly leaving me no errors to guide what i have done wrong. To resolve these issues i would regularly turn to W3schools. W3schools have been a very valuable tool in my learning process as I recieve clear guidelines on the processes i need in order to make things work. I used w3schools in this asssignment in order to remind myself of the creation of histograms and the neccessary code in order to display correctly. This was very useful as it gave me a standard of work to aim towards. From then on i was able to pass on the information to my peers in order to aid them with any similar issues they were facing. 

In the future, I would like to expand my knowledge in cyber security using Portswigger and HTB 'Hack the box' to delve deeper into pen testing and build up a portfolio of reports and certificates so I can place myself firmly on the path to my career of choice. I was very excited to meet the associates of Pentest People who gave me plenty of insight and resources when looking to get into the industry. From this i will be able to confidently enter a field of work where i am able to protect people from the ever growing threats online.
