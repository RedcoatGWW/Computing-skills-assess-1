# Reflection

Through this course i have learnt a lot about how i interact to the world of computer science and it has given me insight as to what i would like to achieve in my future. My favourite and easiest task has defienetly been with UX design as i enjoy creation and development which was a huge U-turn from when i started this course. Pairing that with Tech stack it has been very exciting, seeing how front end and back end come together with such satisfaction when everything starts working.

My hardest task has been Computing skills as due to my lack of knowlege with mathmatics and algebra. 

Algebra bad
peers helped with visualization
started taking on HTB
Interest in cyber security and ethical hacking
Improve maths and algebra
Continue learning on HTB and build a portfolio


Over the course of the two semesters, you should have developed technical and practical skills, and
you should have used Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and other technical and practical programming tools
as part of the COM4043 module as well as other modules in the programme.

Reflect on a range of technical issues consisting of installations, setting up accounts, configuring
compilers and IDEs, identifying errors, and debugging.

Write 300 - 400 words covering:

1. What tasks you found easiest or hardest (and why).
2. Give an example of a technical issues (related to programming) that you faced, and describe
the steps you took to resolve the issue.
3. How you overcame any challenges (YouTube tutorials? Class notes? Asking peers?).
4. One skill you want to improve (e.g., debugging, data visualization).

5. Next steps for your own computing growth (e.g., “I plan to learn more about Git or code style.”).
